This assignment explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence in software engineering to automate tasks, enhance decision-making, and improve development efficiency. It includes three core tasks—code generation, automated testing, and predictive analytics—alongside an ethical reflection on fairness in AI systems.

Tasks Summary
Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
Implemented a function to sort a list of dictionaries using both GitHub Copilot (AI-generated) and a manual coding approach. The two versions were compared based on efficiency, readability, and development time.

Task 2: Automated Testing with AI
Used Testim.io to create automated test cases for login functionality. One test verified successful login with valid credentials, and the other tested error handling with invalid inputs.

Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
Trained a Random Forest machine learning model on the Breast Cancer dataset to classify issue priority. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and F1-score metrics.

## ⚖️ Ethical Reflection
The report also addresses potential biases in datasets and discusses how tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 can detect and mitigate unfairness in AI models, promoting ethical and inclusive software solutions.
